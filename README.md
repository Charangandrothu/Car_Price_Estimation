# Car_Price_Estimation
The Car Price Estimation project uses machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and LightGBM to predict the price of used cars based on features like make, model, mileage, and year. These models help buyers and sellers determine fair market values. Accurate predictions improve pricing transparency and customer satisfaction.
